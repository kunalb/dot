# dot

## 2024
I'm currently working through refreshing my dot files and reconciling
the different versions across different laptops and systems.

To prevent unhappy accidents, newer versions are collected in the
"2024" version, which also respect `$XDG_CONFIG`. Once complete, I'll
use the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles) set up
to directly clone this repository to my config directory.

tl;dr; expect files to move a lot.


### Software I currently use
- tmux
- emacs
- vim
- sway
- bemenu
- wezterm
